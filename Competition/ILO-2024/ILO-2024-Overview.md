# International Logic Olympiad 2024
## Overview
The International Logic Olympiad in 2024 was the first year it was officially run.
Over **3,500+** participants from **92**
countries and **2,100+** schools participated in the competition. As a competitor in their first year,
there were the occasional bugs, from participants being able to find their scores early to the scoring system being revamped mid-competition.
But nevertheless, the competition was a success in my eyes.

## Scoring
Originally, the scoring system was based on the individual scores of the participants across all three qualification rounds.
The ILO admin intended to take the average of the three scores to determine the final score, and then average that with the scores of your teammates
to ultimately determine which teams would receive invites to the final round hosted at **Stanford University**. 

However, mid-competition, due to various bugs and other issues, the scoring system was changed to take the average 
of the top 2 scores of the individual across the three rounds, and then average it with their teammates. This is the system that is being used in 2025 as well. 

Just to give you an idea of how competitive it was, my team of 4 had an average score of **~94**,
and we did not receive an invitation to the final round.
Talking to the competitors who were invited to the final round, many of them had an average score of **100**. 

## Awards
The structure of the awards was as follows:
- **Gold:** Individuals completed the Olympiad and were in the **top 5% of all participants**
