# 🧠 International Logic Olympiad Guide

Welcome to **Aarsh's International Logic Olympiad (ILO) Guide**!
This guide is designed to help students sharpen their logical reasoning skills, 
gain insights from past years, understand the various tools and techniques used in the competition, and more!
Whether you're new to the ILO or aiming to be a finalist,
I hope this guide will provide useful resources to help you along your journey in the world of logic.

## 👋 About Me
I'm Aarsh,
a **Silver Scholar (Top 10%)**
in the 2024 ILO, **founder of the largest unofficial ILO Discord server** dedicated to discussions,
strategy, and collaboration, and a hopeful **finalist in this year's competition** (2025).
I created this guide because I noticed a lack of structured preparation materials and information critical to performing well. 
My goal is to make logic more accessible to everyone,
whether you're a first-time competitor or an experienced problem solver, because I know that once you get the hang of it,
you will start to observe it everywhere!
